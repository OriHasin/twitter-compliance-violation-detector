## üìä Core Workflow

NOTE: If you want to use Sample Tweets Data instead of real tweets fetching, just change USE_SAMPLE_DATA=True inside config.py

1. **Upload a compliance policy**
   ```bash
   # Example policy structure
   {
     "policy_name": "Social Media Policy",
     "rules": [
       {
         "rule_id": "CONF-001",
         "category": "Confidentiality",
         "description": "Sharing confidential information"
       },
       {
         "rule_id": "REP-001",
         "category": "Reputation",
         "description": "Damaging company reputation"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Scan Twitter accounts**
   ```bash
   # Example request
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/tweets/process" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"usernames": ["employee_handle"], "policy_name": "Social_Media_Policy"}'
   ```

3. **Review detected violations**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/tweets/violations"
   ```
